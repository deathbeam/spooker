SFGL, Simple and Fast Game Library
========================================

#### Making games is a piece of cake with this small library!
SFGL is fully free and open source library, what will help game developers
in making their own games faster. SFGL is based on SFML (Simple and Fast Multimedia Library)
and its binding called SFML.NET. SFML is cross-platform (running on top of OpenGL)
multimedia library, what is really fast and easy to use. Becouse of using cross-platform
libraries, SFGL is able to run on most platforms, including Windows, Linux and even Mac.
